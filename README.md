# Focal Point

NEW FEATURES:
* Timer is now connected to Picker. When you select a Time, async storage gives the timer that data.
* Drop-down menu can only be selected before a run or after a run. You may select a new time before you've started one, or once you complete one.
* When you navigate away from the page, the timer keeps going and remembers your time. It also remembers if you've already picked a time.

SNAGS:
* There is a slight 1-second delay between picker selection and timer display. This may be a symptom of the async fetching data.
